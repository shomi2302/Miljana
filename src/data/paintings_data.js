        overview:
          "At the first exhibition of Miljana NikoliÄ‡, works created during 2017/18 were presented. All the works can be classified under visual investigations of various abstract thoughts and attempts to find a form for the best representation of thoughts or emotions. Paintings and mosaics were created in parallel, seemingly unconnected. How to get answers to insignificant questions? Thoughts about the universe, how to depict traditional scenes about which we have too little information and who cares about that? How to saturate the eye with color to get answers to unasked questions? What is art and, again, who cares about that? Why engage in something that concerns nobody and how to explain that this, simply, is not true?",
